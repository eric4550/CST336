            SpaceX is a company whose goal is to develop technologies that open up the opportunity to living on other planets. The company was founded in 2002, and over the years they have had many failures, but recently have been able to develop a rocket that is
            able to land and be used again for future missions to space. In 2012 they became the first company to successfully deliver cargo to the ISS, and return. The eventual goal, though is to colonize Mars.
