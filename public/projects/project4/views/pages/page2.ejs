            Astropy is a python library meant to create the ability for Python developers to easily compute, and write programs that have a need to implement astronomy data. The entire library is community-based, and is completely developed by people with a like-mindset
            that have a need for this astronomy library, and are willing to add to it for the greater good of future developers.
